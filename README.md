# BWP-Switching-Analyzer
BWP switching helps to save power consumptions as UE can use lower bandwidths(20MHz) than initial BWP(100MHz).
In general, network(gNB) decides BWP switching based on traffic monitoring and the decision depends on user scenarios. e.g. Youtuve live or web browsing.

For analyzing and comparing the effect of various user scenarios, we need to consider the following factors.
1. How long each BWP activated.
2. How many BWP switching happened.

This tool helps you to analyze BWP switching operations.
